Problem Description:  

-> Consider the differential equation governing the simple harmonic motion:  
$$\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + \omega^2 y = 0, for t>0,$$
with the initial conditions $y(0)=y_0=1, \left. \frac{dy}{dt} \right|_{t=0} = 0$ and $\omega=4$.  
-> The exact solution for this problem is given as:  
$$y(t) = cos(\omega t)$$  
-> The given $2^{nd}$ order ODE is transformed into a system of $1^{st}$ order ODEs using the variable transformation as $y = y_1, \frac{dy}{dt}=y_2$.   
-> This system is solved with $\Delta t = 0.1$.
