# Numerical Methods Codes

-> This repository has computer programs written in C++ that implements solution procedures for solving linear and non-linear algebraic equations, ordinary differential equations (ODE) and partial differential equations (PDE).  
-> Finite Difference Method (FDM) forms the basis of the discretization of the governing equations.
