Problem Description:  

-> This program solves the system of non-linear equations with two different initial guesses using Newton-Raphson Jacobian method and checks if the two obtained solutions converge to the same root?  
-> Guess-1: $x = \left[0.1, 1.2, 2.5 \right]^T$  
-> Guess-2: $x = \left[1, 0, 1 \right]^T$  
-> Given system of equations:  
$$x_1+x_2+x_3 = 3$$
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 = 5$$
$$e^{x_1} + x_1 x_2 - x_1 x_3 = 1$$
