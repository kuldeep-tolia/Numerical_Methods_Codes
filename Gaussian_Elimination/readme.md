Problem Description:  

-> This is a program that performs Gaussian Elimination for a square system $Ax=b$ of size $n$x$n$.  
-> Matrix $A$ is defined as $a_{ij} = max(i,j)$ and known vector $b$ is defined as $b= \left[1,1,...,1 \right]^T$.  
-> This matrix system is solved to obtain the solution vector $x$.
