Problem Description:  

-> This program performs a Gaussian Elimination for a square matrix system $Ax=b$ of size $n$x$n$.  
-> The matrix $A$ is defined as $a_{ij} = max(i, j)$ and the known vector $b$ is defined as $b = \left[ 1,1,...,1 \right]^T$.  
-> The matrix system is solved to obtain the solution vector $x$.
