Problem Description:  

-> The heat equation with a source term is  
$$\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + S(x), 0 \leq x \leq L$$  
-> The initial and boundary conditions are $T(x,0) = 0$, $T(0,t) = 0$, and $T(L,t)=T_{steady}(L)$. Taking $\alpha = 1$, $L=15$ and $S(x) = -(x^2-4x +2) e^{-x}$. The exact steady solution is  
$$T_{steady}(x) = x^2 e^{-x}$$  
-> Solve the equation to steady state
